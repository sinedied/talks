# Intro
- For the last 10 years, I've worked as a dev in:
* research, many ESN projects, product team

Now I started working as a dev advocate, and I'll do just that: advocate for developers :)

"Vie ma vie de developpeur"
- what works, what doesn't (* from my experience)

## Developer time
- 100% writing feature code
=> 10x developer

\o/
... or not

## Why it's bad
- product communication (estimates, specs, feedback)
- dev communication (knowledge sharing, tech decisions)
- quality (tests, breaking things)
- teamplay

=> tunnel effect

# Development = teamplay
* code communities (OSS...)
* stakeholders
* clients, end-users
* manager

## Development = communication
- with machine
- with other devs
- with stakeholders
- with end-users
- with PMs

## Team size
Communication matrix, speak about team size and grow effects
- microservices, microfrontends? split responsibilities, reduce team size

## Team balance
Senior + Junior devs

- Senior != I'm always right
- Senior = teach, mentor, guide (& learn)
- Key is open discussion, everyone with equal weight

# Estimate & deliver

Deadline-driven development

## Planning with estimations
- Aknowledge uncertainty
- More precision? Split up
- Micro estimate
- senior vs junior, balance your teams

## Mythical Man Month
- rule of 3 = days \o/
- more people, more complexity != more speed
- Pressure and irrealistic goals!!!
* impact morale
* perverse negative effects (= estimation overhead, quality loss)

## "It's just a button"

Existing code vs Design vs Data vs Constraints vs Tests

## Measure
Otherwise it's just a lucky guess

- measure the right things (MS slides)

# Learn & share

## Doc

# Test, code, refactor

## TOOLS
- OSS tools vs premium tools
- Lib licences
- Recode your own thing vs on-the-shelf
- Invest in your own tooling!

## The zone
- interruptions are bad => we need continuous focus time
- context switching COST A LOT
- open (shouting) spaces
- plan ahead (we are agile)

## Maintain

# Wrapping up

Dev = Understand, Challenge, Design, Estimate, Build, Test, Learn, Write docs, Deliver, Maintain

1. Write feature code
2. Rewrite existing code (maintain, fix, perf...)   | write other code
2. Write tests                                      |
3. Read code, docs, specs                           | understand & learn
3. Learn: pair, docs, share                         |
4. Write docs                                       | collaborate
4. Discuss: challenge, design, estimate, share      |
