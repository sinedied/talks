# 0.Intro

- Me
- Creating 3D objects
  * animation 2d -> 3d (carrÃ© -> cube) with roughjs ?
- CAD vs 3D modeling
  * CAD: 3D modeling for engineering, with parametrized objects
- Tools: open source?
  * Autodesk Fusion 360 https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/
  * Blender
  * FreeCAD https://www.freecad.org/
- Introducing OpenSCAD
  * (I use code + git for everything)
  * https://www.openscad.org/

# 1. Setup
- Install OpenSCAD
- VSCode
- extensions w/ profiles [share!!]
- Libraries: BOSL2
- Post its: photo examples
- Caliper (pied a coulisse)

# 2. Modeling with code
- lego
  * cube
  * cylinders
  * hole
  * holders
  * parametrization
  * mechanical constraints: tolerance
- hook
- horn
- vase

# 3. Real-world example
- timer case
- custom synth stand

# 4. Going further & refs
